                  Landfills are spreading across India at a first at a fast pace

                  segregation is the process of differentiating dry and wet
                  waste and disposing of it into two different beans.

                  scrap to us. If we inculcate the habits of "avoiding tossing
                  trash anywhere" and adopting daily waste segregation, remember
                  we're coming one step ahead in reducing landfills.
